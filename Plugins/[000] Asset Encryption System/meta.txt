# Asset Encryption System (FPK - File Package)
#===============================================================================
# This plugin provides a complete asset encryption and packaging system
# similar to Pok√©mon Flux. It allows you to package and encrypt all your
# game assets (graphics, data, audio) into compressed .fpk files for release.
#
# Features:
# - Compress and encrypt Graphics, Data, and Audio folders
# - Transparent loading (auto-detects dev/release mode)
# - Significantly reduces file size
# - Protects assets from casual extraction
# - JSON-based index for fast file lookup
# - XOR encryption with custom key
#
# Usage:
# 1. During development, work normally with regular files
# 2. When ready for release, open Debug menu and select "Build FPK Packages"
# 3. Packages will be created:
#    - Graphics/Assets_0-.fpk
#    - Data/Data_0-.fpk
#    - Audio/Audio_0-.fpk
# 4. (Optional) Use "Clean FPK Source Files" to remove original files
# 5. Distribute the game with .fpk files instead of folder contents
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Change the ENCRYPTION_KEY in [002] FPK_Core.rb before release!
# - Keep backups of your source files!
# - Test the packages before cleaning source files!
#
# The system automatically detects if .fpk files exist and switches to
# release mode. If not, it uses development mode with regular files.
#
# Debug Menu Options:
# - Build FPK Packages: Create encrypted packages
# - Clean FPK Source Files: Delete original files (CAUTION!)
# - Toggle FPK Mode: Manually switch between dev/release mode for testing
