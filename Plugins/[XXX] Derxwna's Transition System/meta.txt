# Derxwna's Custom Vs. Transitions System for Essentials Version 21.1
# Developed by Derxwna Kapsyla
# With heavy assistance from Vendily
#
# This will likely not work properly on V20.1 and backwards without extensive editing of the timings,
# as this uses V21's new timing system for frame agonstic wait counts.
#
# This comes with an example map! First you will need to create a new map, save your project, get the ID
# for that map, then copy this plugin's Data Folder to your project's root directory, and rename
# the "TRANSITION_EXAMPLE_MAP.rxdata" to the ID of the new map you made (You will need to delete the
# new map you just made OUTSIDE of RPG Maker XP first!)
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This plugin allows users to make more cinematic Vs. Transitions before important 
# battles, in a style vaguely reminiscent of the Gen 6 Pre-Battle Vs. Transitions.
# This system is fairly easy to use! This file will show off how to use it to its fullest
# potential.
#
# Supported battle types:
#   * Trainer Single Battles
#   * Trainer Double Battles
#   * Trainer Triple Battles
#   * Wild Single Battles
#
# Things you can achieve with this system:
#   * Custom background per trainer/event encounter
#     - This can be defined per-event by putting in $game_temp.vs_transition_bg into a
#       script command.
#     - If this is not defined, it will default to a "Plains" background, which has been
#       provided with this plugin.
#   * Custom name definitions per trainer/event encounter
#     - There is a three step hierarchy system when it comes to picking the name to display
#       in the Vs. Transition sequence. The hierarchy is as follows:
#       * Step 1: The plugin checks for the existence of a file in Transitions/DTS/Names
#         with the following names:
#         * Trainers: "Name_(TRAINERTYPE)"
#         * Pokemon: "Name_(SPECIESNAME)_W"
#         * Double Trainer Battles: "Name_(TRAINERTYPE1)_(TRAINERTYPE2)"
#         * Triple Trainer Battles: "Name_(TRAINERTYPE1)_(TRAINERTYPE2)_(TRAINERTYPE3)"
#           * For Double and Triple Battles it should be noted that the format listed above is
#             STRICT. If it isn't in that exact format, it will not see the file as existing and
#             proceed to Step 2.
#       * Step 2: If a graphic wasn't found, it will then check for the existence of a value
#         stored in "$game_temp.vs_name". This is used to define a custom name.
#         * Key example: If you don't want to reveal a trainer's name as Silver, but instead ???.
#       * Step 3: If neither a graphic nor a value was found, this will default to the name of
#         the trainer as identified in trainers.txt. 
#  * Different portraits for Pokemon based on their form
#    - For Pokemon like Deoxys who have custom forms that they can take in battle, you can have the
#      filename for that Pokemon have the form ID and it will reflect as such in the Vs. Transition.
#      This is achieved by having a portrait in the Transitions/DTS/PTs folder with the following
#      filename format: "Wild_(POKEMON)_(FORMID)". Example, Deoxys Speed would be "Wild_DEOXYS_3".
#      A glossary of accepted filenames will be provided at the end.
#
# This system can definitely have improvements made to it (The support of Double and Triple Wild Battles),
# but as it is this is a good start for anybody who wants to breathe new life into the Pre-Battle sequence
# of their games.
#
# A glossary of all the accepted commands and filenames can be found in this section.
#
# * $game_temp.vs_transition_bg = "(Value)" - This is used to set the Background used for the next Vs. Transition.
#   If not defined, it will default to "Plains".
#   - Example: $game_temp.vs_transition_bg = "Starlight"
#   - Files are stored in the Transitions/DTS/BGs folder, and must be prefixed with "BG" before the background name.
#
# * $game_temp.vs_name = "(Value)" - This is used to set a name to display at the bottom of the Vs. Transition.
#   The game will check for an image first; if not found, it will check if this exists. If this is not defined, it will
#   default to the Trainer or Pokémon's name as defined in their relevant PBS files.
#   - Example: $game_temp.vs_name = "Captain Ringo" / $game_temp.vs_name = "Vs. Arceus (Steel)
#   - Files are stored in the Transitions/DTS/Names folder, and must be named accordingly:
#     * Trainers: "Name_(TRAINERTYPE)"
#     * Pokemon: "Name_(SPECIESNAME)_W"
#     * Double Trainer Battles: "Name_(TRAINERTYPE1)_(TRAINERTYPE2)"
#     * Triple Trainer Battles: "Name_(TRAINERTYPE1)_(TRAINERTYPE2)_(TRAINERTYPE3)"
#       * For Double and Triple Battles it should be noted that the format listed above is
#         STRICT. If it isn't in that exact format, it will not see the file as existing.
#
# * Transitions/DTS/Balls: The folder where the modified overlay_lineup.png file is located. Currently
#   this is all that is here.
#
# * Transitions/DTS/BGs: The folder where all backgrounds are stored for the Vs. Transition system.
#
# * Transitions/DTS/Names: The folder where all custom names are stored for the Vs. Transition system.
#
# * Transitions/DTS/PTs: The folder where all portraits are stored for the Vs. Transition system.
#   - "Char_(VALUE)" is used for Trainers
#   - "Wild_(VALUE)" is used for Pokemon
#     - "Wild_(VALUE)_(ID)" is used for Pokemon with different forms.
#
# I hope you find enjoyment in using this system! People've asked me to release this to the public for a long
# time, and now I can finally do so. I've had a lot of fun refining this and using it over the years. Just
# remember to credit myself and Vendily if you use this! Also, some of the assets came from the Gensou
# Ningyou Enbu Asset Collection Pack- if you use the Arceus Portrait, please credit them as well!
