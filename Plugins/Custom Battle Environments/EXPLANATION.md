# DirtyWater Battle Background - Quick Explanation

If you surf or fish on a DirtyWater tile, the game normally shows the water background, not your custom one. This is because the game always uses "water" for surfing battles.

The plugin fixes this by forcing the game to use your dirtywater graphics for the background and message bar whenever the environment is DirtyWater.

Just make sure you have these files in Graphics/Battlebacks:
- dirtywater_bg.png
- dirtywater_base0.png
- dirtywater_base1.png
- dirtywater_message.png
