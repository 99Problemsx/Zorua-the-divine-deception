## 🔑 YOUR ENCRYPTION KEY

**Current Key:** `ZoruaDivineDeception2024_CustomKey_921121`

**⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS:**

- ✅ Saved in `ENCRYPTION_KEY.txt`
- ❌ Don't commit to GitHub!
- ❌ Don't share publicly!
- ✅ Keep a secure backup somewhere else
- ✅ You need this to decrypt files later

**If you lose this key:**

- You can still restore from `.backup` files
- But you won't be able to decrypt the encrypted files

---

## 🛡️ WHAT'S PROTECTED

### ✅ ENCRYPTED (Protected):

1. **All game data** (.rxdata files)

   - Pokemon stats, moves, abilities
   - Items, trainers, encounters
   - Map data and events
   - System configuration

2. **All game code** (.rbe files)
   - Custom battle mechanics
   - Unique features
   - Plugin functionality
   - Event scripts

### ❌ NOT ENCRYPTED (By Design):

1. **Graphics** (PNG, GIF files)

   - Players see these during gameplay
   - Can't reverse-engineer game data from images
   - Standard for Pokemon fangames

2. **Audio** (BGM, SE, ME files)
   - Players hear these during gameplay
   - Can't extract game logic from audio
   - Standard for Pokemon fangames

---

## 🔒 SECURITY LEVEL

**Protection Level:** Same as Pokemon Flux & Phoenix Rising

**What it protects against:**

- ✅ Casual players opening files in editors
- ✅ Simple copy-paste of game data
- ✅ Stealing custom scripts
- ✅ Easy modification of stats
- ✅ Reading map events
- ✅ Extracting custom features

**What it doesn't protect against:**

- ❌ Determined hackers with Ruby knowledge
- ❌ Memory dumping during runtime
- ❌ Advanced reverse engineering
- ❌ Decompiling the game executable

**This is standard and acceptable for Pokemon fangames!**
