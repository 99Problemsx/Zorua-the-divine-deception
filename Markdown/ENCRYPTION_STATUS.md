## üìä What's Protected

### ‚úÖ **CURRENTLY ENCRYPTED (88 files)**

#### Game Data Files

- ‚úÖ Actors.rxdata
- ‚úÖ Animations.rxdata
- ‚úÖ Armors.rxdata
- ‚úÖ Classes.rxdata
- ‚úÖ CommonEvents.rxdata
- ‚úÖ Enemies.rxdata
- ‚úÖ Items.rxdata
- ‚úÖ Skills.rxdata
- ‚úÖ States.rxdata
- ‚úÖ System.rxdata
- ‚úÖ Tilesets.rxdata
- ‚úÖ Troops.rxdata
- ‚úÖ Weapons.rxdata
- ‚úÖ MapInfos.rxdata

#### Map Files

- ‚úÖ All 75 map files (Map001.rxdata through Map075.rxdata)

### ‚ùå **NOT ENCRYPTED**

#### Graphics (Intentional - Same as Pokemon Flux & Phoenix Rising)

- ‚ùå Pokemon sprites (Graphics/Pokemon/)
- ‚ùå Trainer sprites (Graphics/Trainers/)
- ‚ùå Item icons (Graphics/Items/)
- ‚ùå Character sprites (Graphics/Characters/)
- ‚ùå Battle graphics (Graphics/Battle/)
- ‚ùå UI elements (Graphics/UI/)
- ‚ùå All other PNG/GIF files

> **Why not encrypt graphics?**
>
> - Most Pokemon fangames (Flux, Phoenix Rising, Reborn) don't encrypt graphics
> - Would slow down game performance
> - Graphics are harder to reverse engineer into usable game data
> - Players can see them during gameplay anyway

#### Audio Files

- ‚ùå Background music (Audio/BGM/)
- ‚ùå Sound effects (Audio/SE/)
- ‚ùå Music effects (Audio/ME/)

> **Why not encrypt audio?**
>
> - Same reasons as graphics
> - Audio files can be heard during gameplay
> - No game data advantage from audio files

#### PBS Files (Text Data)

- ‚ùå PBS/pokemon.txt
- ‚ùå PBS/moves.txt
- ‚ùå PBS/items.txt
- ‚ùå etc.

> **Note:** PBS files are compiled into the encrypted .rxdata files!
> The compiled versions ARE protected, only the source PBS files remain readable.

## üîë Encryption Details

**Encryption Method:** XOR Cipher (Simple for loop - same as Phoenix Rising)  
**Encryption Key:** `ZoruaDivineDeception2024_CustomKey_715118`

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Keep this key safe! You need it to:**

- Decrypt files for development
- Make changes to game data
- Update your game in the future

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Level

**What it protects against:**

- ‚úÖ Casual players opening files in text editors
- ‚úÖ Simple hex editor inspection
- ‚úÖ Direct Marshal.load attempts
- ‚úÖ Copy-pasting game data to other projects
- ‚úÖ Easy modification of stats, items, Pokemon

**What it doesn't protect against:**

- ‚ùå Determined hackers with Ruby knowledge
- ‚ùå Memory dumping while game is running
- ‚ùå Decompiling the game code itself
- ‚ùå Advanced reverse engineering

**Protection Level:** **Medium** (Same as Pokemon Flux & Phoenix Rising)  
This is standard for Pokemon fangames and is sufficient for most purposes.

## üìÅ Backup Information

**Backups Created:** ‚úÖ Yes  
**Backup Location:** `Data/` folder  
**Backup Format:** `[filename].backup_1760696707`

**Example backups:**

- `Data/Actors.rxdata.backup_1760696707`
- `Data/Map001.rxdata.backup_1760696707`
- etc.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep these backups safe!** They're your unencrypted originals.

## üéÆ How to Use Your Encrypted Game

### For Players (Release Build)

1. The game loads normally - encryption is automatic!
2. Players won't notice any difference
3. Save files work the same way
4. No performance impact

### For Development

1. **To edit data:** Run `ruby test_encryption.rb` and choose option 3 (Decrypt)
2. **Edit your files** in RMXP or text editors
3. **Re-encrypt:** Run `ruby test_encryption.rb` and choose option 2 (Encrypt)

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Decrypt for development
ruby test_encryption.rb
# Choose option 3

# Re-encrypt after editing
ruby test_encryption.rb
# Choose option 2
```

## üöÄ Before Releasing Your Game

### ‚úÖ Checklist

- [x] Changed encryption key to unique value
- [x] Encrypted all game data files (88 files)
- [x] Created backups of original files
- [ ] Test game loads correctly
- [ ] Test saving/loading works
- [ ] Test battles, items, Pokemon stats
- [ ] Test map transitions
- [ ] Remove backup files from release build
- [ ] Don't include encryption key in release

### üì¶ What to Include in Release

```
‚úÖ Include:
- All encrypted .rxdata files in Data/
- Graphics/ folder (unencrypted)
- Audio/ folder (unencrypted)
- Plugins/Custom Encryption/ folder
- Game.exe / mkxp executable

‚ùå DON'T Include:
- .backup files
- Unencrypted .rxdata files
- test_encryption.rb (optional)
- Your encryption key file
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Game won't load after encryption

1. Make sure `ENCRYPTION_ENABLED = true` in `Plugins/Custom Encryption/001_Custom_Encryption.rb`
2. Check that encryption key hasn't changed
3. Try restoring from backup files

### Need to decrypt everything

```bash
ruby test_encryption.rb
# Choose option 3: Decrypt DATA files
```

### Lost encryption key

1. Check this file for the key: `ZoruaDivineDeception2024_CustomKey_715118`
2. Check `Plugins/Custom Encryption/001_Custom_Encryption.rb` for the key
3. If truly lost, restore from .backup files

### Want to encrypt graphics too

1. Open `Plugins/Custom Encryption/002_Graphics_Encryption.rb`
2. Change `GRAPHICS_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED = false` to `true`
3. Run encryption from Debug Menu
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This may slow down your game!

---

## üìû Support

For issues:

1. Check `errorlog.txt` in game folder
2. Check backup files exist
3. Verify encryption key is correct
4. Test with `ruby test_encryption.rb` option 5 (Check status)

---

## üéâ Summary

Your game data is now protected with the same level of encryption used by popular Pokemon fangames like Flux and Phoenix Rising!

**88 files encrypted** ‚úÖ  
**Backups created** ‚úÖ  
**Ready for development** ‚úÖ

Your game data is safe from casual modification while remaining easy for you to work with during development.

**Good luck with Zorua the Divine Deception! ü¶äüéÆ**
